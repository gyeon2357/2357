> > ### I'm an editorial designer by trade, trained in typography. In the field of typography, I explored the structure of fonts and studied the different mediums in which letters are used. The traditional book and the web are inseparable. Websites were created as a way for scientists to share papers with each other. Websites were created to fill in the gaps left by books. The process of moving from scrolls to codices to other scrolls seems natural in retrospect. If you look at the basic structure of a website, whether desktop or mobile, like the history of a book, you can see similarities rather than differences, coexistence rather than competition, portability, durability, and cost-effectiveness, and this fact enriches my work. The moment I think, "What would this website be like if it were a book?" (or vice versa), I realize that all media are connected.
